# üöÄ Project Documentation: fistproject

üëã Welcome to the documentation for `fistproject`! This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its structure, how to set it up, and its key features.

## ü§î Project Overview

`fistproject` is a simple Django project demonstrating fundamental concepts of the framework, including project and app setup, model definition, form creation, view implementation (both function-based and class-based), URL routing, integration with the Django admin panel, and basic template rendering.

The primary functional component implemented within the `firstapp` is a basic reservation system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python installed (compatible with Django 5.2).
    *   `pip` (Python package installer).
    *   A MySQL server running and accessible.
2.  **Clone the repository:** (Assuming your code is hosted in a repository)
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd fistproject
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual repository URL if applicable.)*
3.  **Create a virtual environment:** (Recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
5.  **Install dependencies:**
    The main dependency is Django, along with a MySQL connector library like `mysqlclient`.
    ```bash
    pip install Django~=5.2.0 mysqlclient
    ```
    *(Note: The project files indicate Django 5.2.)*
6.  **Database Setup:**
    Ensure your MySQL server is running. Update the `DATABASES` setting in `fistproject/settings.py` with your specific database credentials.

    \[
    \text{DATABASES} = \{ \\
    \quad \text{'default'}: \{ \\
    \quad \quad \text{'ENGINE'}: \text{'django.db.backends.mysql'}, \\
    \quad \quad \text{'NAME'}: \text{'django_db'}, \\
    \quad \quad \text{'USER'}: \text{'root'}, \\
    \quad \quad \text{'PASSWORD'}: \text{'password123@X'}, \\
    \quad \quad \text{'HOST'}: \text{'127.0.0.1'}, \\
    \quad \quad \text{'PORT'}: \text{'3306'}, \\
    \quad \quad \text{'OPTIONS'}: \{ \\
    \quad \quad \quad \text{'init_command'}: \text{"SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"} \\
    \quad \quad \} \\
    \quad \} \\
    \}
    \]

    **‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING:** Using the `root` user with a simple password like `password123@X` is highly discouraged for anything beyond local development. For production, use dedicated database users with strong passwords and appropriate permissions.
7.  **Apply Migrations:**
    Apply the initial database schema migrations for Django's built-in apps and your `firstapp`.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
8.  **Create a Superuser (Optional, for Admin access):**
    To access the Django administration panel, you'll need a superuser account.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

## üì¶ Dependencies

*   **Django**: The web framework (version 5.2 as indicated by the `settings.py` header).
*   **mysqlclient**: A connector library to allow Django to communicate with the MySQL database.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Structure

The project follows a standard Django layout:

fistproject/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fistproject/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.py ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asgi.py # ASGI entry point ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.py # Project settings ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls.py # Project URL configurations ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wsgi.py # WSGI entry point ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firstapp/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrations/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0001_initial.py # Initial model migration (MenuItem) ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 0002_reservation.py # Reservation model migration ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.py ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.py # Admin site configuration ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps.py # App configuration ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forms.py # Model forms ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py # Database models ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests.py # App tests (currently empty) ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ views.py # View functions and classes ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/ # Directory for project-level templates (inferred) ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # Template for the reservation form ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manage.py # Django‚Äôs command-line utility

*(Note: The exact location of the `templates` folder might vary depending on your `settings.py` configuration and how templates are loaded. Based on `APP_DIRS=True`, `index.html` is likely located inside `firstapp/templates/` or `fistproject/templates/`.)*

## ‚ú® Key Features & Modules

*   **`fistproject` (Project):**
    *   Handles overall project settings (`settings.py`).
    *   Defines the main URL routing (`urls.py`) which includes paths like `/function`, `/class`, and `/reservation`.
    *   Provides the WSGI and ASGI entry points (`wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`).
*   **`firstapp` (Application):**
    *   **`models.py`**: Defines the database models:
        *   `MenuItem`: Represents a menu item with `name` (CharField) and `price` (IntegerField).
        *   `Reservation`: Represents a reservation with `first_name`, `last_name` (CharFields), `guest_count` (IntegerField), `reservation_time` (DateField - auto-now), and `comments` (CharField).
    *   **`forms.py`**: Contains `ReservationForm`, a `ModelForm` based on the `Reservation` model, making it easy to handle reservation data input.
    *   **`views.py`**: Contains the logic for handling requests:
        *   `hello_world` (Function-based view): Returns a simple "Hello World" HttpResponse.
        *   `HelloBangladesh` (Class-based view, `View`): Returns a simple "Hello Bangladesh, This is Dhaka" HttpResponse for GET requests.
        *   `home` (Function-based view): Handles displaying and processing the `ReservationForm`, rendering the `index.html` template, and saving valid form data to the database.
    *   **`admin.py`**: Registers the `Reservation` model with the Django admin site, allowing easy management of reservation data through the admin interface.
    *   **`migrations/`**: Contains database migration files generated by Django, tracking changes to the models.
*   **`urls.py` (Project Level):** Maps specific URL paths to views within `firstapp`:
    *   `/function/`: Maps to the `hello_world` view.
    *   `/class/`: Maps to the `HelloBangladesh` view.
    *   `/reservation/`: Maps to the `home` view.
*   **`index.html` (Template):** A basic HTML template used by the `home` view to display the reservation form. It includes a CSRF token and renders the form fields using `{{ form.as_p }}`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`fistproject/`).
2.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The server will typically start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
4.  Access the different views by visiting the corresponding URLs in your browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/function/`, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/class/`, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/reservation/`).

## ‚úÖ Testing

The project includes a `tests.py` file in the `firstapp` directory. However, it is currently empty, indicating that tests have not yet been implemented for this application.

To run tests (once implemented):
```bash
python manage.py test
